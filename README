Moai lua unit test template example.

To run lua tests:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make 
make test

On windows:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G "MSYS Makefiles"
make
make test

...or if you have a copy of visual studio, just use the cmake-gui and then
choose 'build' on the ALL_TESTS project.

Notes:

This COPIES the lua sources into the build directory. This is not ideal,
as it means you have to run cmake every time you want to run your test
suite. 

MOAI is irritating and doesn't return a valid error code when there is a
lua error, so we're forced to use the crappy 'did lua generate success file?'
method of telling if a build failed.
